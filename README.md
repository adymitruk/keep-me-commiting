# keep-me-commiting
Remind me on slack if I haven't contributed publicly on GitHub today

Recently I've been trying to keep up with my Open Source contributions; be it
personal OS projects or community packages. More commits means I'm making community
packages better, even if only by a little bit.

This little slackbot will let you know if you're forgetting to make a public contribution today!
If he finds you you've been slacking, he'll PM you, then check back in an hour to see if you've righted your wrongs.

Have you made a public commit yet? If not how about making a PR to make this bot better.

# Usage

`node index.js -t asfjdsfsdfkljasdflkasd -g wski -s wski`

`-t` is your slackbot token.
`-g` is your github username.
`-s` is your slack username.
